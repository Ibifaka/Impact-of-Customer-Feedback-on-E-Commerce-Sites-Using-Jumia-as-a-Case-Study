by,power issues,"The device is awesome with great bass. But the power should be worked on.  You can turn it off remotely except you leave it discounted  and then goes off after 3mins. There should be a indication that the pods are charging in the case. The ear loops should be made firm and better go avoid looseness causing it to drop off the pods.
Sometimes people find it hard to hear and the noise cancellation is not as strong as advertised.
Apart from that, they are great. I recommend  anyone getting the device.",4,21-11-2022

,Kaiiiiii??????,"Abeg, the price is worth the value! 

First of all, the bass is just so so good and at the same time having a clear, distinct quality sound! When I'm watching Netflix with it, it's as if I'm in cinema + the Environmental Noise cancellation is superb, I didn't even know a gen was on around me, it was when I has removed the earbud I even noticed, to tell you how good it is!

The earbuds are designed so well that you would you even forget an earbud is in your ear! It fits so well.

They definitely didn't lie about battery life,.used it for 4hrs straight and only 50% still remained!

Perhaps, where I would just like them to improve is the touch control, wished it was flat for easier touching. 

But in all....10/10 for this????",5,22-09-2022

Though the 3 lacks enough bass for music. I'm not an audiophile, but I enjoy my music, and the lack of bass it's obvious. 

The Freepods 3 shines through with it's connectivity.

F,Hmmm!!! ????,"Well, after some usage for a month now, the Pod 3 beats my presumption from the battery life to the sounds(beats) to the packaging and the rage it covers even the designs and clarity while making calls, and my favorite parts are the packaging, design and sounds output while the ear tips are on BUT they’re sets back which I find as a big deal and got me wondering (1) You have to manually select it to the pod during calls including incoming calls which doesn’t make it totally wireless because I have to bring out my phone (2) lately they’re breaks in transmission while usage(music) for a second or two which i find annoying at times.

,review,"This is my first earbuds experience.
It looks pretty cool, the design is spectacular.
The sound quality is great, especially the bass.
For a bass lover this is phenomenal, the best part is the bass is outstanding but it doesn't drown out the highs and mids.
I wouldn't for outdoors/busy environments with the ear tips on (bass mode).
The ear tips block out external sounds and amplify the bass, almost sounding like strong headphones.
Without the ear tips you can't get much bass which sucks but you would be able to hear what's happening around you and it feels a bit lighter on the ear without the tips.
I haven't used it long enough to say more but it's quite authentic for the price range, it's a good buy",5,22-11-2021

s,FAIR,"Not as responsive as I thought it would be. Music stops on its own sometimes when you hold one of the pods on your hand without using the designated gesture.
The sound is fair, thought it would be better. But overall, I like it. I like the size and the way it fits in my ears like it was crafted specially for me, love the feel and design. Oraimo is really heading somewhere :)",3,13-10-2021

l,Top Notch,"The Bass production is very very punchy and awesome in the bass mode i.e when the silicone eartips are plugged in.
 Design wise, they are also cool.

My complains are the fact that when the silicone tips are removed, there goes the bass production and I would had really loved that mode because the silicone might start causing pains to my ears after some time.

I also do not like the fact that with a single earbud on, you cannot go to previous and next song together, only one.

Finally, the fact that the Earbuds cannot be switched off and on manually is my greatest turn off. 

Imagine leaving the Earbuds outside the case let's say you leave the house without the case and they turn off on their own when the Bluetooth is not connected for some time, then there's no way to turn it on again until you can access the case to put it in and take it out again.",3,11-10-2021
