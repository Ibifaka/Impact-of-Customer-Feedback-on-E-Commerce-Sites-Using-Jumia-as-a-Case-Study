Music stops on its own sometimes when you hold one of the pods on your hand without using the designated gesture.\nThe sound is fair, thought it would be better. But overall, I like it. I like the size and the way it fits in my ears like it was crafted specially for me, love the feel and design.

The battery is also good as the buds last long hours with music playing. My only complain is that they hurt my ears. I've tried all the ear tips and none of them fit well into my ear, so listening to music for long periods is not always smooth for me. Maybe those with bigger ears will enjoy the buds better. Aside that, the Oraimo Freepod 3 is great and worth the price.","Rating(of 5)":3,"Review date":"23-11-2021"},{"index":1543,"Review Body":"Its okay","Rating(of 5)":3,"Review date":"23-11-2021"},{"index":1544,"Review Body":"Very nice","Rating(of 5)":5,"Review date":"23-11-2021"},{"index":1545,"Review Body":"The bass is really nice and loud.

I am here to tell you to go for it.  It's worth every money I spent on. The bass is what I love the most about it and the sleek design, it's portable and cute in the ear. I have to say  it is the best earbuds ever????. You won't regret. I hardly do reviews but this made me so happy ????

Music stops on its own sometimes when you hold one of the pods on your hand without using the designated gesture.\nThe sound is fair, thought it would be better. But overall, I like it. I like the size and the way it fits in my ears like it was crafted specially for me, love the feel and design.
